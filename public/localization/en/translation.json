  "roadmap.text": "1. General Overview of the TurbineX Project\nProject Name: TurbineX\n\nMain Goal:\nTurbineX is an innovative renewable energy project that combines powerful wind turbines with cutting-edge blockchain solutions. We are building an ecosystem where\ngreen energy becomes an asset accessible to everyone and integrating it into the crypto industry through tokenized energy assets.\n\nWhat sets us apart from competitors?\n🔹 Energy tokenization – token holders receive a share of the generated energy, turning wind into a real digital asset.\n🔹 Decentralized platform – transparent smart contracts ensure fair profit distribution and investment opportunities.\n🔹 Smart wind turbines – our technology optimizes energy production and reduces costs, increasing mining efficiency.\n🔹 Partnerships with crypto platforms – integration with DeFi and NFTs to create unique monetization opportunities for green energy.\n\nTurbineX is the future of renewable energy in the crypto world! 🚀💨💰\n\n2. Key Technologies of TurbineX\n\nWhat technologies do we use?\nTurbineX combines advanced wind energy and blockchain technologies, creating a unique ecosystem for renewable energy tokenization. We implement:\n\n🔹 Blockchain and smart contracts (Ethereum / BSC / Solana) – for transparent profit distribution and energy tokenization.\n🔹 NFT wind turbines – each turbine can be represented as an NFT, and owners receive a share of the energy production revenue.\n🔹 DeFi integration – staking and farming of tokens backed by real energy.\n🔹 Meme coin $TURX – our signature token, fun, hyped, and useful for the community.\n\nWhat makes our technical solution unique?\n✅ Energy = Digital asset – tokenization allows investors to own a part of green energy and earn stable income.\n✅ Gamification – users can “collect” their NFT turbines, build farms, and participate in crypto games.\n✅ Sustainability and trendiness – a combination of the real energy sector with trending crypto formats (meme coin + NFT + DeFi).\n✅ Zero Carbon Mining – the ecosystem supports cryptocurrency mining powered by clean energy, reducing the industry's carbon footprint.\n\nTurbineX is not just renewable energy — it's a new way to monetize the wind through crypto! 🌪️💸🚀",
  "roadmap.text1": "3. TurbineX Project Architecture\n\nThe TurbineX architecture is built on the TON blockchain and integrated with the Telegram app in a Tap-to-Earn model. Several key components interact within the system to generate, tokenize, and monetize wind energy.\n\nSystem components:\n1️⃣ Smart Contract on TON\n🔹 Manages the issuance and distribution of $TURX tokens.\n🔹 Facilitates transactions between investors and wind turbine owners (NFTs).\n🔹 Automates staking and farming of tokens.\n\n2️⃣ Telegram App (TurbineX App)\n🔹 User-friendly interface with Tap-to-Earn mechanics.\n🔹 Earn $TURX by engaging in activities and supporting the project.\n🔹 Buy, sell, and upgrade NFT wind turbines.\n\n3️⃣ NFT Wind Turbines (TurbineX NFT)\n🔹 Each wind turbine is a unique digital asset.\n🔹 NFT owners receive a share of generated energy in tokens.\n🔹 Upgrade and trade turbines within the ecosystem.\n\n4️⃣ DeFi Module (Staking and Farming)\n🔹 $TURX holders can stake tokens to earn passive income.\n🔹 Farming with additional bonuses for supporting green energy.\n\n5️⃣ TurbineX Marketplace\n🔹 A marketplace for buying, selling, and renting NFT wind turbines.\n🔹 Interaction with DeFi platforms to integrate liquidity.\n\nHow do the components interact with each other?\nUsers log into the TurbineX Telegram app, complete tasks, or play the 'Tap-to-Earn' game and earn $TURX.\nAccumulated tokens can be exchanged, staked, or used to buy NFT wind turbines.\nNFT wind turbines generate passive income in tokens based on power and rarity.\nThe TON smart contract processes all transactions, ensuring security and transparency.\nDeFi interaction allows staking and farming tokens, increasing profitability.\nUsers can trade NFTs and tokens on the marketplace, creating an active ecosystem.\nWhat makes TurbineX unique?\n🔥 Combining real-world wind energy with a crypto game.\n🔥 Using TON for fast and cheap interactions.\n🔥 An ecosystem with NFT, DeFi, and Tap-to-Earn mechanics to encourage activity.\n🔥 Passive income from owning digital assets.\n\nTurbineX is not just a project, it's a new era of monetizing renewable energy via blockchain! 🌪️⚡💰\n\n4. How is $TURX used?\n\n🔹 Game mechanics in the Telegram app\nUsers earn $TURX by completing tasks and interacting with the 'Tap-to-Earn' feature.\nThe more activity, the higher the rewards.\n\n🔹 Buying and upgrading NFT wind turbines\nWind turbines (NFTs) can be purchased with $TURX and upgraded to increase their power and profitability.\n\n🔹 Wind energy income\nNFT wind turbine owners receive daily payouts in $TURX based on the turbine's power.\nThe more turbines, the higher the income.\n\n🔹 Staking and farming\n$TURX holders can stake tokens to earn a share of the platform's overall profits.\nAdditional bonuses are given for long-term staking.\n\n🔹 Fees and token burning\nA portion of transaction fees goes towards buybacks and burning $TURX, reducing inflation.\nThis makes the token more valuable and scarce.\n\n🔹 Decentralized governance (DAO)",
  "roadmap.text2": "Token holders can participate in votes for project development.\nInfluence new mechanics and platform improvements.\n\nEconomic model (tokenomics)\n💰 Total supply: 1,000,000,000 $TURX\n📊 Distribution:\n\n40% – Activity rewards (Play-to-Earn, staking)\n20% – Project and ecosystem development\n15% – Exchange listings and liquidity\n15% – Marketing and partnerships\n10% – Team and development\n🔥 Deflationary mechanism – part of the tokens is burned, reducing supply and increasing value.\n\nWhy will $TURX increase in value?\n✅ Real value – token is tied to clean energy generation and NFT assets.\n✅ Deflationary model – burning mechanisms reduce total supply.\n✅ High demand – token is needed for staking and owning NFT turbines.\n✅ TON ecosystem – low fees and fast network speed.\n\nTurbineX is not just a token – it's a new form of digital energy! ⚡🌪️🚀",
